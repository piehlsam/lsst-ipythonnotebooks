# lsst-ipythonnotebooks
This repo is a collection of ipython notebooks that I used to help myself learn how to use the LSST software stack (https://github.com/lsst) and code development, as well as get familiar with how to use the butler and work with astronomical data files.  It is meant for future use in helping others learn the LSST stack.

This copies directly much of what can be found at https://github.com/ctslater/lsst_analysis_demos and https://github.com/lsst-dm/belgrade-2016. This repo collects the ipython notebooks from these two and adds some of my own comments.

This is not meant to be a finished product or presentation, and there are several places where I have left comments that indicate my lack of understanding or peculiarities in the performance of the code that I cannot explain.
